# IOS_Map_App
Repo containing the mandatory assignment for week 12, IOS course, Computer Science

In this app, I implemented Maps. With this map, you can place markers and save them to your Firestore database.

- Tracking the user with GPS and WIFI and provide realtime updates.
- Create markers by longpressing.
- Get markers from Firebase.
- Upload new markers to Firebase.

Remember to add your own private Google-Info.plist from Firebase, or else it will not sync up with your own database.
